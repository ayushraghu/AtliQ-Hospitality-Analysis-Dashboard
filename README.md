## Problem Statement

Atliq Grands is a leading chain of five-star hotels operating across India, with over 20 years of experience in the hospitality industry. Recently, the company has faced a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury/business hotel segment due to increased competition and ineffective decision-making.

To address this challenge, the management has decided to adopt Business and Data Intelligence as a strategic initiative. However, with no in-house analytics team, Atliq Grand's revenue management department has partnered with a third-party service provider to analyze historical data and generate actionable insights that can help regain market position and drive growth.

### Key learnings -
1. DAX Measures -
   1.1 RevPAR = Revenue / total capacity
   1.2 ADR =  Revenue / total bookings
   1.3 DBRN = total bookings / no. of days
   1.4 DSRN = total capacity / no. of days
   1.5 Occupancy % = successful bookings / total capacity and many more.
3. By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the           booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.
4. Learned how to apply conditional formatting, such as data bars, to columns like Revenue.

### Some key insights - 
1. The Luxury category accounted for 61% of the total revenue.
2. Week 24 accounted for the highest revenue at $139 million, with a postive week over week (WoW) change of 0.21.
3. There is a slight increase in RevPAR during weekends, likely driven by leisure travelers or holiday demand, while the relatively stable ADR indicates that pricing does not differ drastically.
4. AtliQ Exotica performs better compared to all 7 type of properties with 320 Million revenue, rating 3.62, occupancy percentage 57 and cancellation rate as 24.4%.
5. With 'Others' contributing 40% and Direct Online only 9% to RevPAR, it appears the company isn't leveraging coupons to maximize direct online revenue through their website.
6. The Elite class recorded the highest number of bookings in May and July, and the highest cancellation rate of 25% in June.

### Conclusion -
1. Optimize Weekend Pricing:
   The company should focus on increasing RevPAR and ADR during weekends by implementing a fair and competitive pricing strategy.

2. Boost Direct Online Revenue:
   To enhance RevPAR from direct online bookings, the company should attract more customers through targeted coupon campaigns and exclusive online offers.

3. Reduce Elite Class Cancellations:
   In the Elite class segment, the company should aim to reduce the cancellation rate by offering incentives for non-cancellation, improving pre-stay communication, and enhancing overall booking flexibility.
